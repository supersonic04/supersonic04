# 👋 Hi, I’m Praveen

I help operations-heavy teams solve real-world problems with **data, automation, and practical AI**.

By day, I lead digital modernization efforts in fire and emergency services. On the side, I run [Emberlytic](https://emberlytic.com) — a part-time consulting practice focused on turning messy workflows into scalable systems.

## 🧠 What I Build
This GitHub is a living lab where I publish:

- 🔧 **Automation tools** — low-code and scripting examples (AutoHotkey, Power Automate, n8n)
- 📊 **Ops-focused dashboards** — R, SQL, and reporting prototypes
- 🤖 **AI use case demos** — lightweight GPT-driven experiments for frontline and municipal use
- 🔧 **Tools for Emergency Services** — tools and proof of concepts for emergency services
- 🧱 **Homelab + systems infrastructure** — projects running on Proxmox, Docker, and GCP

Most of these repos are open, messy, and evolving — just like real systems work.
