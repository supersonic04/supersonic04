## 👋 Hi, I’m Praveen

I help operations-heavy teams solve real-world problems with **data, automation, and practical AI**.

By day, I lead digital modernization efforts in fire and emergency services. On the side, I run [Emberlytic](https://emberlytic.com) — a part-time consulting practice focused on turning messy workflows into scalable systems.

## 🧠 What You'll Find Here

This GitHub is my working lab — where I share ideas in progress, not just polished code. Expect:

- 🔧 **Automation tools** — low-code flows, scripting (AutoHotkey, Power Automate, n8n)
- 📊 **Ops-focused dashboards** — built with R, SQL, and open reporting frameworks
- 🤖 **AI use case demos** — lightweight GPT-driven tools for municipal and frontline needs
- 🚒 **Emergency services tools** — alerting, readiness, and reporting prototypes
- 🧱 **Homelab + systems** — projects running on Proxmox, Docker, and GCP
